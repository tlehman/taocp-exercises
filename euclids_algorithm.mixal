* Program E: An implementation of Euclid's Algorithm
* by tlehman on 1380146870, first full MIX program
*
* The idea behind thef algorithm comes from the mathematical fact that
* gcd(m, n) = gcd(n, m mod n), this is where the reduction step comes from.
*
* E1. [Find remainder]
*    r <- m mod n
* E2. [Is it zero?] if r=0, terminate
* E3. [Reduce]
*    m <- n
*    n <- r (m mod n)
